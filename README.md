I have been working with this api for 4 months.
I worked and studied the following things:
 - loading 2D and 3D models (also known as meshes)
 - implementation of the movement of different objects along a certain trajectory and also randomly
 - rotation translation scaling shearing of different objects
 - worked with images 3D model texturing
 - OpenGL shaders
 - in the folder Laborator5/ i made a small game where i applied this knowledge
